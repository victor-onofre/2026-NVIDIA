# NVIDIA iQuHACK 2026 Challenge

## Overview

The Low Autocorrelation of Binary Sequences (LABS) problem is a notoriously difficult optimization challenge, critical for high-performance radar and telecommunications.

Your objective is to take the current classical state-of-the-art Memetic Tabu Search (MTS) and evolve it. Rather than jumping to a purely quantum solution, you will engineer a hybrid quantum-enhanced workflow where samples from a quantum algorithm are used to seed the classical MTS population. You must then push the limits of performance by GPU-accelerating both the quantum simulation and the classical search components.

**We want you to vibe code!** 

In modern R&D and this challenge, speed matters, but rigor and coordination matter more. We expect you to employ Agentic Strategies, utilizing AI tools that can reason across your codebase to act as your collaborators while you operate as the Technical Leadership Team. Your collective job is to decompose the problem, delegate tasks across your team and AI agents, and most importantly verify the work. As Leads, you must clearly communicate your planning, workflow, and solution, ensuring your team remains aligned and ready to pivot even as technical challenges shift your strategy.

## Logistics, Milestones, and Evaluation

In this challenge, you will mimic a real-world R&D pipeline, moving from rapid prototyping to high-performance deployment. Success in this challenge requires clear orchestration; review the section [Assign Your Technical Roles](https://github.com/iQuHACK/2026-NVIDIA/blob/main/LABS-challenge-Phase1.md) in the GitHub repository to define your team's PICs for Project Lead, GPU Acceleration, Quality Assurance, and Technical Marketing. These roles ensure your team remains aligned while managing both human and AI-agent workflows.

During the challenge, you will utilize two distinct platforms, each chosen for a specific phase of your development lifecycle. 

* **Phase 1 (Prototyping): qBraid** | [Specifications](https://github.com/iQuHACK/2026-NVIDIA/blob/main/LABS-challenge-Phase1.md)

    For the "Ramp Up" and initial CPU validation, you will work on Milestones 1 and 2 in [qBraid](https://account-v2.qbraid.com/). qBraid is your "Dev Environment" — a zero-setup, pre-configured cudaq sandbox that allows you to focus entirely on mastering the algorithm and logic without worrying about infrastructure overhead.

    ### Milestones:
    1. **Ramp Up**: Master the state-of-the-art for LABS via a scaffolded tutorial.
    
    2. **Research & Plan**: Perform due diligence to design a custom quantum strategy and acceleration plan.

* **Phase 2 (Acceleration): Brev** | [Specifications](https://github.com/iQuHACK/2026-NVIDIA/blob/main/LABS-challenge-Phase2.md)

    Once your logic is validated, you will "graduate" your code to [Brev](https://brev.nvidia.com/) to complete Milestone 3 and 4. Brev provides on-demand access to a wide variety of NVIDIA GPU architectures (L4s, T4s, A100s, ...). We have provided a pre-configured GPU environment for this environment called a **Launchable**. You will use Brev to test your solution across different hardware configurations and unlock full GPU acceleration.

    ### Milestones: 
    3. **Build**: Inmplement your algorithm in CUDA-Q and validate it on a CPU in qBraid, then migrate to Brev to deploy full GPU acceleration.

    4. **Showcase and Retrospective**: Present your solution, performance metrics, and your AI-driven workflow.

**Good luck. Let the agents build the code, you build the architecture.**

    * If it's **NOT** installed follow Steps 4-6 
    * Otherwise, go directly to Step 7

4. Add the CUDA-Q environment by navigating to the ENVS tab in the right sidebar, and click on `+ ADD` 

5. Navigate to `CUDA-Q and GPU Quantum Environments`

6. Install CUDA-Q (v0.13.0)

7. Once installation is complete, open the challenge notebook `01_quantum_enhanced_optimization_LABS.ipynb` under the `tutorial_notebook` directory 

8. In the bottom left corner, make sure the kernel is set to `Python 3 [cuda q-v0.13.0]` 

9. Happy Hacking!

Congratulations on finishing the first part of the challenge! 

You will now get to run your code on real GPUs using NVIDIA's Brev Platform. Don't worry, you don't need to pay for anything! Once completing Phase 1 and your logic is validated, we will provide your team with a **$20 Brev coupon code**.

The desginated GPU Acceleration PIC on your team is responsible for majority of the qBraid to Brev migration. Go to the `GPU_PIC_Brev.pdf` document [here](https://github.com/iQuHACK/2026-NVIDIA/blob/main/GPU_PIC_Brev.pdf) and follow the instructions.

For any questions or additional assistance using Brev, see the [Brev Console Reference](https://docs.nvidia.com/brev/latest/console.html) or reach out to the NVIDIA team on discord.

### Vibe Coding Tips and Resources
* Implement verification tests as part of your workflow (e.g., [unittests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)

* Introduce context into your prompting (e.g., [context7](https://context7.com), agent skills (`skills.md`), MCP, etc.)

* Use different [prompting strategies](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques)

* Keep prompts short; open up new chats occassionally to avoid the context window getting too large
* Meta vibe code. Take some pulse checks occassinoally as you're working by feeding your session back into an agent and ask them how you could improve your prompting.
